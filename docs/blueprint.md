# **App Name**: ColorEye

## Core Features:

- Image URL Handling: Accept an image URL via the /v2 endpoint with a 'url' parameter. Handle various image formats, including webp.
- Dominant Color Extraction: Analyze the image and extract one or two of its dominant colors.
- JSON Output: Return a JSON response containing the original image URL and an array of the extracted color hex codes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5), offering a sense of trust and visual depth appropriate for image analysis.
- Background color: Very light indigo (#F0F2F9), a desaturated tone of the primary color that creates a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Vibrant amber (#FFC107), positioned as an analogous color that creates contrast without overwhelming.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean and modern aesthetic, suitable for both headings and the image URL display.
- A clean and simple layout will improve UX. Ensure clear separation of the image URL and color palette to avoid any confusion.
